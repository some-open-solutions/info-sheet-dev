Data is encrypted in Collector on the participant's computer using a public key. Whilst data will generally then be transferred to a server using HTTPS protocol, even if this is not the case the encryption of the data on the participant's computer will prevent anyone other than the researcher being able to decrypt the data. To decrypt the data, the researcher will need to use a password to decrypt the private key required to decrypt the participant's data.
